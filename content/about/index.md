# About me

My journey into technology was long and bizarre but there's nothing about it I
regret. After high school, I worked several odd jobs before joining the military.
Once my service was complete I moved to bookkeeping and transitioned into public
accounting before finally arriving at my technology position.

Since joining the IT crowd ;-) I have gone from Systems Administrator to DevOps
to Site Reliability Engineer. This meant a journey from BASH to Perl to Ruby
and now to Golang (which I love, by the way). Although, BASH never really goes 
away!

Life has changed a lot even though many of the fundamentals behind what I do on 
a daily basis remain the same. Essentially, my role is to keep `stuff` online. 
What used to be done with horrendous scripts and non versioning I can now do with 
provisioning tools such as Ansible and Chef.

The most important aspect of myself and career is a continuous forward momentum
achieved via a never-ending desire to learn and grow. I feel, at times, as if I'm
making up for lost time, somehow. And this sense of less pushes me forward on a
daily basis. There is no difference for me between my hobbies, my passions and 
my work. They blend together seemlessly and this leads to a wonderful work/life
balance.

On a personal note, I'm the father of three incredible little men and I love to
run. It's my release and allows me to eat probably more chocolate than I should.
