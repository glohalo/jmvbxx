# First Post

I created this site to serve as an online representation of who I am professionally. The idea is to combine a bit of visual, along with a resume and some blog posts here and there. 

I'm not a huge fan of some of the more traditional ways of representing oneself and decided that this was the best tool to allow insight into who I am and why I work in this field.
