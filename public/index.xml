      <description>First Post I created this site to serve as an online representation of who I am professionally. The idea is to combine a bit of visual, along with a resume and some blog posts here and there.</description>

      <description>About me My journey into technology was long and bizarre but there&amp;rsquo;s nothing about it I regret. After high school, I worked several odd jobs before joining the military. Once my service was complete I moved to bookkeeping and transitioned into public accounting before finally arriving at my technology position.
Since joining the IT crowd ;-) I have gone from Systems Administrator to DevOps to Site Reliability Engineer. This meant a journey from BASH to Perl to Ruby and now to Golang (which I love, by the way).</description>
